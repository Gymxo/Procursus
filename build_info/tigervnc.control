Description: Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote display system which allows you to view and interact with a virtual desktop environment that is running on another computer on the network. Using VNC, you can run graphical applications on a remote machine and send only the display from these applications to your local machine. VNC is platform-independent and supports a wide variety of operating systems and architectures as both servers and clients.

TigerVNC is a high-speed version of VNC based on the RealVNC 4 and X.org code bases. TigerVNC started as a next-generation development effort for TightVNC on Unix and Linux platforms, but it split from its parent project in early 2009 so that TightVNC could focus on Windows platforms. TigerVNC supports a variant of Tight encoding that is greatly accelerated by the use of the libjpeg-turbo JPEG codec.
